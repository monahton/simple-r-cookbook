# Introduction

## Who Is This Book For?

This book is for wet lab researchers, particularly those with little or no coding experience, who want to use R for:
- Organizing data from experiments
- Performing basic statistical analysis
- Creating publication-ready figures
- Conducting simple bioinformatics workflows

If you're a biologist who’s ever opened Excel and thought, "There must be a better way," this book is for you.

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this book, you’ll be able to:
- Read and clean your experimental data
- Perform key analyses like t-tests, ANOVAs, or DEGs
- Make beautiful plots using `ggplot2`
- Write simple R scripts and reports using R Markdown

## What This Book Is *Not*

This is not a book about programming theory, advanced statistics, or complex machine learning. It’s about **practical recipes** to make your life in the lab easier and your results clearer.
