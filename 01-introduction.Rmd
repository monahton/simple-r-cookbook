## A Little History won't hurt...

R is a statistical programming language. The name **R** comes from the first letters of its creators’ names: **Ross Ihaka** and **Robert Gentleman**, who developed R in the early 1990s at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. It’s also a cheeky nod to the **S programming language**, which came before it.

> 🧪 So:  
> **R = Robert + Ross**  
> …and a respectful hat tip to **S**, its parent language.

S was originally developed at Bell Labs in the 1970s for statistical computing. While S went commercial (in products like **S-PLUS**), R stayed true to its academic and open-source roots. And today? R has taken over the world of data science, statistics, and bioinformatics.

## Why Use R?

Still wondering why you should learn R instead of just sticking with Excel or some point-and-click software? Here's what makes R an absolute game-changer especially for wet lab scientists:

### 📦 1. R Can Handle Much Larger Datasets  
While Excel starts crashing at ~1 million rows, R just stretches and says, “Cool, what’s next?” With efficient data structures and memory management, R can comfortably handle large-scale datasets. Think of gene expression matrices, proteomics tables, or high-throughput screening results.

### 🔁 2. R Is Scriptable = Reproducible  
Every click in Excel is a mystery. Every line in R is a documented, reproducible step. You can rerun your entire analysis with a single script — no more "I have no idea how I made this figure."

### 💸 3. R Is Open Source!  
That’s right, it is totally free! No license fees, no paywalls, no trials. Just install it and go. You can also install thousands of R packages without needing a university budget or a support contract.

### 💻 4. R Works Everywhere  
R runs on **Windows**, **Mac**, **Linux**, and even the **cloud** if for some reason you do not want to install it on your device. You can also write your code on a laptop and run it later on a cluster, server, or cloud-based platform like RStudio Cloud or Binder.

### 🌍 5. R Is Everywhere in Science  
R is used by academic labs, pharma companies, bioinformatics cores, government agencies, and more. If there’s a paper with a volcano plot in it, odds are someone used R.

### 🛠 6. R Has an Active Community  
There are thousands of developers and contributors constantly improving R. Need a new tool? Someone’s probably already written a package for it. If not, you can write one yourself and become internet-famous (kind of).

## R for Bioinformatics? _Yes, Please!_

R isn’t just for plotting bar charts or fitting linear models; it’s a major powerhouse in **bioinformatics**.

R has packages for:

- RNA-seq (e.g., `DESeq2`, `edgeR`, `limma`)
- Single-cell analysis (`Seurat`, `scran`, `monocle`)
- Variant analysis (`VariantAnnotation`, `vcfR`)
- Functional enrichment (`clusterProfiler`, `topGO`)
- Visualization (`ggplot2`, `ComplexHeatmap`, `pheatmap`)
- And everything in between

It’s integrated into pipelines and workflows used by researchers around the world — from core facilities to biotech startups to big pharma.

> TL;DR: If your data ends in “-seq”, you probably need R.

## What’s RStudio and How Is It Different from R?

That's a great question!  
You have probably heard before people using the terms R and RStudio interchangeably. While they are related and most of the time ( _more or less_ ) referring to the same thing, they are not quitely the same:

- **R** is the programming language itself. It is what runs the different functions and make the analyses.

- **RStudio** is the **dashboard**. It gives you buttons, panels, a file explorer, syntax highlighting, plots that appear like magic, and even a built-in terminal.

To make the difference clear, here’s an analogy:

> 🏎️ **R**  = the **engine** of a car. It’s powerful, but not super user-friendly on its own.  
> 🚗 **RStudio** = the car's entire dashboard and steering wheel

You could technically drive the engine alone, but it’s going to be a wild ride. Use RStudio, and you get a much smoother experience.

RStudio also:

- Helps you manage projects and scripts
- Shows plots, tables, and files in one place
- Makes debugging and coding much easier
- Works beautifully with bookdown (like this book!)
