This is a hands-on, low-stress, high-impact guide to data analysis for researchers who spend more time at the bench than behind a keyboard. We get it: you’re busy pipetting, optimizing qPCRs, decoding cryptic Western blots that resemble a Rorschach test, and navigating Excel spreadsheets that look more like digital Jenga than data. Learning to code might feel intimidating, time-consuming, or just not for you. That’s exactly why this book exists. This cookbook gently walks you through using R, a powerful, free, open-source language that’s basically the Swiss army knife of data analysis. You’ll learn how to: Import and tidy up messy experimental data Create stunning, publication-quality plots Run basic statistics with confidence Write reproducible scripts that save you from “Spreadsheet Hell” If you can troubleshoot your PCR with Google, you can learn R. And this book will show you how — one clear recipe at a time. 1.1 Why This Book? As a wet lab biologist, you’re already generating valuable data from qPCRs, Western blots, RNA-seq, ELISAs, microscopy, and more. But analyzing and presenting that data should not mean fighting with Excel or running outdated SPSS scripts. R empowers you to: Clean and reshape your data with precision Perform statistical tests and visualize results Automate repetitive tasks Keep your analyses reproducible and transparent This cookbook is designed to give you just enough R to be independent — in the best possible way. 1.2 Who Should Read This Book? This book is for:  Biologists who’ve never coded before (and aren’t sure they want to)  Researchers tired of copy-pasting into Excel  Graduate students doing data-heavy projects  Lab technicians and PIs looking to modernize their workflows  Anyone who wants to understand what ggplot2 is (and why it’s not a sequel) You don’t need a background in programming, math, or stats; just curiosity and a willingness to try. 1.3 What You Will Learn By the end of this book, you’ll be able to: Speak fluent data.frame (or at least understand what one is) Import your experimental data like a pro (no more drag-and-drop chaos) Clean up messy spreadsheets without crying Make beautiful plots with ggplot2 that your PI will actually like Run basic statistical tests without copying formulas from a forgotten textbook Write simple scripts that do your dirty work for you (reproducibly!) Think of this as your R lab manual — but way more helpful and a lot less dry. 1.4 What This Book Is Not This is not: A deep dive into computer science, data engineering, or machine learning A comprehensive stats textbook (no scary formulas here, promise!) A book that assumes you’ve ever written code before Going to teach you how to build a neural network to predict the future of your PCR Instead, it’s a practical, real-life-friendly guide for people who just want to analyze their data without losing their minds. If you’ve ever: Spent 3 hours manually formatting an Excel file Googled “how to calculate SEM in Excel” for the 10th time Cried because your plot labels wouldn’t fit …you’re in the right place!! 1.5 Citation If you found this cookbook useful in your work or teaching, please cite it as: Abou Alezz, M.

This book is for wet lab researchers, particularly those with little or no coding experience, who want to use R for: - Organizing data from experiments - Performing basic statistical analysis - Creating publication-ready figures - Conducting simple bioinformatics workflows If you’re a biologist who’s ever opened Excel and thought, “There must be a better way,” this book is for you. 2.2 What You Will Learn By the end of this book, you’ll be able to: - Read and clean your experimental data - Perform key analyses like t-tests, ANOVAs, or DEGs - Make beautiful plots using ggplot2 - Write simple R scripts and reports using R Markdown 2.3 What This Book Is Not This is not a book about programming theory, advanced statistics, or complex machine learning. It’s about practical recipes to make your life in the lab easier and your results clearer. "],["getting-started.html", "3 02 Getting Started", " 3 02 Getting Started Content coming soon.
