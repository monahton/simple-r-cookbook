# Getting Started

## Navigating RStudio Like a Pro (or at Least Like You’ve Used It Before)

When you first open **RStudio**, you might feel like you’ve accidentally launched a spaceship dashboard. Don’t worry — you’re not alone. Let's break it down:

RStudio is typically divided into **four panes**:

1. **Console** (bottom left):  
   This is where R does the talking. You type code here, R runs it, and outputs appear right away.

2. **Source** (top left):  
   This is where you write and save scripts (`.R` files, `.Rmd` files, etc.). Think of it as your lab notebook — but smarter and less likely to get coffee-stained.

3. **Environment/History** (top right):  
   Here you’ll see all the variables and objects you've created (like your tidy data frames or test results), and a history of commands you've run.

4. **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer** (bottom right):  
   A multitool: browse your files, view plots, install packages, read help files, and more. It’s like the utility belt for your R lab work.

If something disappears, don’t panic. Go to **View > Panes** and bring it back.

## Getting Set Up: Creating a Project

Before writing any code, you’ll want to create an **RStudio Project**. Why?

Because:
- It helps R keep track of your files
- It keeps your working directory consistent (no more mystery paths)
- It makes collaboration easier
- It gives you peace of mind

### To create a new project:

1. Go to **File > New Project**
2. Choose **New Directory**
3. Pick **Book project using bookdown** (if you're writing this book)
4. Give your project a name (e.g., `simple-r-cookbook`)
5. Choose a location for it
6. Click **Create Project**

💡 Pro tip: Your project will have a file ending in `.Rproj` — this is your golden ticket. Always open this file to launch your project.

## Organizing Your Project Directory

A little structure goes a long way — especially when your files start multiplying like bacteria in rich media.

Here’s a recommended layout:

> simple-r-cookbook/   
├── data/ # Raw and cleaned datasets (CSV, XLSX, etc.)  
├── figures/ # Plots, diagrams, and exported images  
├── scripts/ # R scripts you write (optional if using bookdown)  
├── output # results from the various analyses  
├── docs # additional log files, papers, ...etc  

> 📦 Keep things tidy. If you’ve ever opened a folder called “final_final_correct_version2.xlsx”, you already know why.

## Console vs Script: What’s the Difference?

In RStudio, you can write R code in two places:

- The **Console** is for quick one-off commands. It's like talking to R in real time.  
  Example: `2 + 2` or `getwd()`

- The **Script editor** is where you write and save full workflows or analyses. It’s like your digital lab notebook that doesn't forget things.

Here’s why you should **use scripts as much as possible**:
- You can save your code and come back to it later
- You can re-run everything with one click (or `Ctrl + Shift + Enter`)
- You can annotate your code with comments (starting with `#`) to explain what you're doing (and why)
- You can avoid repeating yourself

> Console = Post-it note  
> Script = Protocol in your lab notebook

Both have their place, but your future self will thank you for using scripts.

Ready to run your first bit of code? Try this in your console:

```{r}
message("Hello, biologist! You’re now officially coding.")
```
