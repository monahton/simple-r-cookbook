# Welcome

Welcome to **A Simple R Cookbook for Wet Lab Biologists**!  
This book is written for life scientists who want to learn R for everyday data analysis in the lab.

## Why This Book?

As a wet lab biologist, you're already collecting valuable data whether from qPCR, RNA-seq, imaging, or ELISAs. R is a powerful tool that lets you analyze, visualize, and share your data reproducibly and efficiently. This cookbook teaches you how to do that with clear, bite-sized recipes.
